## Objective : What does the games do ?

Instead of moving around to catch the critters like what Pokemon Go did, a new game would made which instead involves visiting certain websites to catch the Pokemon. We were supposed to create the Pokedex, gym locations, player dictionary ,PokeDex dictionary and more for the game. 

Some data structures were created and to be used for analysis:

* pokemon_gyms - Collection of gym location websites using python list
* players - A list of players using nested dictionary in python
* pokedex - A list of pokemon (playing monsters) using nested dictionary in python

What we do:

    Load data file "pokedex_basic.csv" from repo
    Load into memory and parse it thru some conversion and clean
    Calling statistical module to work out the statistical properties.
